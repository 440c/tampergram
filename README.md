# tampergram
A plugin for instagram via tampermonkey to change your current instagram name.

## NOTE

- This script is only local and doesn't change for other users.
- I also made this because someone in a discord call asked me to!
- They gave me code that never worked and i fixed some issues half of the code isn't mine.

## Features

- Instagram-wide username change * local only.
- Display the username in the url. (still working on bugs with this.)
- Change posts, followers, following counts. (in work)
